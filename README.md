Inputs:
* Home Team Shooting (for & against)
* Home Team Turnovers (for & against)
* Home Team Free Throws (for & against)
* Home Team Offensive Rebounds (for & against)
* Home Team Total Points (for & against)
* Away Team Shooting (for & against)
* Away Team Turnovers (for & against)
* Away Team Free Throws (for & against)
* Away Team Offensive Rebounds (for & against)
* Away Team Total Points (for & against)

Outputs: 
* Spread (Home team perspective)
* Moneyline (Confidence 0 to 1 the Home team wins)
* O/U (Total Points in Game)
